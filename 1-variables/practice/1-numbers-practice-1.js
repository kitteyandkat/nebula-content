// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable

// Create two numbers, assign them to variables and add them together
 let x = 52
 let y = 74

// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract the smaller two from the largest
let b = 7
let c = 15
let d = 72

// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other
let e = 42
let f = 6

// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply one from the other
let g = 65

// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console 
let i = 7564

console.log(i)


// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?

/* Modulo represents the remainder of a division problem for instance:

7/3 = 2r1
%= 1

it would be useful to do operations with the remainder and not the product itself. */
